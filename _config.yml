          MICCAI 2023
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          **Authors**: Jun Lyu et al. (<u>Michael Tänzer</u>, co-author)

          **Abstract**: Cardiac MRI, crucial for evaluating heart structure and function, faces limitations like slow imaging and motion artifacts. Undersampling reconstruction, especially data-driven algorithms, has emerged as a promising solution to accelerate scans and enhance imaging performance using highly under-sampled data. Nevertheless, the scarcity of publicly available cardiac k-space datasets and evaluation platform hinder the development of data-driven reconstruction algorithms. To address this issue, we organized the Cardiac MRI Reconstruction Challenge (CMRxRecon) in 2023, in collaboration with the 26th International Conference on MICCAI. CMRxRecon presented an extensive k-space dataset comprising cine and mapping raw data, accompanied by detailed annotations of cardiac anatomical structures. With overwhelming participation, the challenge attracted more than 285 teams and over 600 participants. Among them, 22 teams successfully submitted Docker containers for the testing phase, with 7 teams submitted for both cine and mapping tasks. All teams use deep learning based approaches, indicating that deep learning has predominately become a promising solution for the problem. The first-place winner of both tasks utilizes the E2E-VarNet architecture as backbones. In contrast, U-Net is still the most popular backbone for both multi-coil and single-coil reconstructions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, presents a summary of the submitted results, reviews the employed methods, and offers an in-depth discussion that aims to inspire future advancements in cardiac MRI reconstruction models. The summary emphasizes the effective strategies observed in Cardiac MRI reconstruction, including backbone architecture, loss function, pre-processing techniques, physical modeling, and model complexity, thereby providing valuable insights for further developments in this field.

          **Abstract**: Quantitative cardiac magnetic resonance T1 and T2 mapping enable myocardial tissue characterisation but the lengthy scan times restrict their widespread clinical application. We propose a deep learning method that incorporates a time dependency Latent Transformer module to model relationships between parameterised time frames for improved reconstruction from undersampled data. The module, implemented as a multi-resolution sequence-to-sequence transformer, is integrated into an encoder-decoder architecture to leverage the inherent temporal correlations in relaxation processes. The presented results for accelerated T1 and T2 mapping show the model recovers maps with higher fidelity by explicit incorporation of time dynamics. This work demonstrates the importance of temporal modelling for artifact-free reconstruction in quantitative MRI.

          **Abstract**: Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) enables us to probe the microstructural arrangement of cardiomyocytes within the myocardium in vivo and non-invasively, which no other imaging modality allows. This innovative technology could revolutionise the ability to perform cardiac clinical diagnosis, risk stratification, prognosis and therapy follow-up. However, DT-CMR is currently inefficient with over six minutes needed to acquire a single 2D static image. Therefore, DT-CMR is currently confined to research but not used clinically. We propose to reduce the number of repetitions needed to produce DT-CMR datasets and subsequently de-noise them, decreasing the acquisition time by a linear factor while maintaining acceptable image quality. Our proposed approach, based on Generative Adversarial Networks, Vision Transformers, and Ensemble Learning, performs significantly and considerably better than previous proposed approaches, bringing single breath-hold DT-CMR closer to reality.

          **Abstract**: As diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) gains popularity in cardiac imaging due to its unique ability to non-invasively assess the cardiac microstructure, deep learning-based Artificial Intelligence is becoming a crucial tool in mitigating some of its drawbacks, such as the long scan times. As it often happens in fast-paced research environments, a lot of emphasis has been put on showing the capability of deep learning while often not enough time has been spent investigating what input and architectural properties would benefit cardiac DTI acceleration the most. In this work, we compare the effect of several input types (magnitude images vs complex images), multiple dimensionalities (2D vs 3D operations), and multiple input types (single slice vs multi-slice) on the performance of a model trained to remove artefacts caused by a simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) acquisition. Despite our initial intuition, our experiments show that, for a fixed number of parameters, simpler 2D real-valued models outperform their more advanced 3D or complex counterparts. The best performance is although obtained by a real-valued model trained using both the magnitude and phase components of the acquired data. We believe this behaviour to be due to real-valued models making better use of the lower number of parameters, and to 3D models not being able to exploit the spatial information because of the low SMS acceleration factor used in our experiments.

          **Abstract**: State-of-the-art pre-trained language models have been shown to memorise facts and perform well with limited amounts of training data. To gain a better understanding of how these models learn, we study their generalisation and memorisation capabilities in noisy and low-resource scenarios. We find that the training of these models is almost unaffected by label noise and that it is possible to reach near-optimal results even on extremely noisy datasets. However, our experiments also show that they mainly learn from high-frequency patterns and largely fail when tested on low-resource tasks such as few-shot learning and rare entity recognition. To mitigate such limitations, we propose an extension based on prototypical networks that improves performance in low-resource named entity recognition tasks.

          ChatGPT-web is a simple one-page web interface to the OpenAI ChatGPT API. To use it, you need to register for an OpenAI API key first. All messages are stored in your browser's local storage, so everything is private. You can also close the browser tab and come back later to continue the conversation.  ChatGPT-web will allow more customization, and since it uses the commercial OpenAI API it should be more reliable. It's also much cheaper than ChatGPT Plus - at $20 per month, you would need to use 10 million tokens on the OpenAI API for this to break even. Finally, since ChatGPT-web is open source, so you can host it yourself and make changes as you want.
